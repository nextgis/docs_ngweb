Administrator interface
================================

Home page
--------------------------------

After login to administrative interface the user is taken to the home page shown 
on :numref:`admin_index_pic`

Resource view
------------------

After login to administrative interface the user is taken to home page shown on :numref:`resource_group`.

.. figure:: _static/resource_group_eng.png
   :name: resource_group
   :align: center
   :width: 16cm

   Resource groups


The content of resource group is displayed after a click on resource name in a child resources pane of main resource group (see item 4 in :numref:`admin_index_pic`). On resource group page there is a pane with a list of resources in a main group and user permissions pane.
Layer properties are displayed after a click on a name of a layer in child resources pane. E.g. user can click on a resource of type vector layer.

After a click on layer in child resources pane user is taken to a vector layer properties and attributes page (see  :numref:`options_resource_group`).

To view feature table after login navigate to a child resource group (see item 4 in :numref:`admin_index_pic`) where would be displayed resource types. Then select from child resources a resource with type vector layer and press the "Table" icon opposite the resource or select an action for a vector layer called "Feature table" in actions pane (see :numref:`admin_table_objects_upload`).

.. figure:: _static/feature_table_choice_eng.png

.. _ngw_update_resource:

Update resource
---------------

To edit a resource after login navigate to a child resource group (see item 5 in :numref:`admin_index_pic`), where would be displayed resource types. Then select from child resources a resource with type vector layer and press the "Pencil" icon opposite the resource or select the layer and then select an action called "Update" in actions pane (see :numref:`ngw_window_update_edit_resource`).
 
.. figure:: _static/ngw_window_update_edit_resource.png
   :name: ngw_window_update_edit_resource
   :align: center
   :width: 16cm

   Selection of "Update" action in action pane

In opened window "Update resource" (see :numref:`ngw_window_update_resource1`) you can edit parent of the selected resource, add description, metadata and attributes of the resource.

.. figure:: _static/ngw_window_update_resource1_eng.png
   :name: ngw_window_update_resource1
   :align: center
   :width: 16cm

   "Update resource" window

On the first tab "Resource" you can edit the next fields:

1. Display name (you can change the resource's name)
2. Keyname
3. Parent (you can change the resource group through moving the resource)
4. Type

You can move resources from one resource group to another after their creation too. To do it press Parent drop down menu and select resource group to move the resource to in "Select resource" window (see :numref:`ngw_resource_selection`). Then press OK and "Save" button.

.. figure:: _static/ngw_resource_selection_eng.png
   :name: ngw_resource_selection
   :align: center
   :width: 16cm

   "Select resource" window

If the resource is moved successfully, the information about it appears in a new resource group and is replaced from the previous one.

The tab "Description" allows to edit or delete a text or to add a new text and to save it after pressing "Save" button:  

.. figure:: _static/ngw_description_window_eng.png
   :name: ngw_description_window
   :align: center
   :width: 16cm
  
   "Description" tab

The tab "Metadata" allows to add and delete metadata, and to display them in a table using "Add" (Text, Integer, Float) and "Remove" operations:  

.. figure:: _static/ngw_metadata_tab_eng.png
   :name: ngw_metadata_tab
   :align: center
   :width: 16cm

   "Metadata" tab

The table contains three columns: 

1. Key. It allows to describe metadata features (author, date, version etc.)
2. Type: Text, Integer, Float
3. Value. Value corresponds key type

The tab "Attributes" contains a table with vector layer attributes (see :numref:`ngweb_admin_layers_attr`).

.. figure:: _static/admin_layers_attr_eng.png
   :name: ngweb_admin_layers_attr
   :align: center
   :width: 16cm

   "Attributes" tab

* Tick in "FT" column means that the attribute is displayed in the identification window.
* Tick in "LA" column means that the attribute gives its name during the identification and forming of the tabs list.

For each field name you can set the corresponding pseudonym to use it for display in the identification window instead of the name.

   The identification window

.. _ngw_attributes_edit:

Delete resource
---------------

Web GIS allows to delete uploaded data through deleting of the corresponding resources. 

To delete the resource after login navigate to a child resource group (see item 5 in :numref:`admin_index_pic`), where would be displayed resource types. Then select from child resources a resource with type vector layer and press the "Cross" icon opposite the resource or select the layer and then select an action called "Delete" in actions pane (see :numref:`ngw_window_update_delete_resource`). 

.. figure:: _static/ngw_window_update_delete_resource.png
   :name: ngw_window_update_delete_resource
   :align: center
   :width: 16cm

   Selection of "Delete" action in action pane
   
In the opened "Delete resource" window (see :numref:`ngw_deletion_resource`) you need to tick "Confirm deletion of the resource" and press "Delete" button. 


.. figure:: _static/ngw_deletion_resource_eng.png

   Delete resource

If the resource was deleted successfully, the information about it disappear in the corresponding resource group.

Data export to CSV and GeoJSON formats
---------------------------------------
  
Web GIS allows to download/export data in CSV and GeoJSON formats.

To download data after login navigate to a child resource group (see item 5 in :numref:`admin_index_pic`), where would be displayed resource types. Then select from child resources a resource with type vector layer or PostGIS layer you need to export and select an action called "Download as GeoJSON" or "Download as CSV" in actions pane "Vector layer" (see :numref:`ngweb_data_export`).

.. figure:: _static/ngweb_data_export_eng.png
   :name: ngweb_data_export
   :align: center
   :width: 16cm

   Data export in various formats

NextGIS Web allows you to export data in the following formats:

* :term:`GeoJSON`
* :term:`CSV`
* CSV for Microsoft Excel
* ESRI Shape
* AutoCAD DXF
* Mapinfo TAB
* MapInfo MIF/MID
* GeoPackage

While exporting to some formats additional files are created, for example CSVT (field description) and PRJ (projection description) for CSV, CPG (code page) for ESRI Shapefile.

To export data:

#. Open a Vector or PostGIS layer, the data of which you want to export;
#. Select the item: menuselection: `Features -> Save As` on the right pane: ref:` web interface <ngw_admin_interface> `;
#. Specify the format and encoding of the data;
#. If necessary, you can compress the result into a ZIP archive (for a number of formats this is the default setting)
#. Save the file to your device
