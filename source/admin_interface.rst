.. _ngw_feature_table_filter_area:

Filter layer features on the Web Map by area
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NextGIS Web has a tool in the Feature table that filters all layer features within a selected area. To choose area limits just draw them on the Web Map.

Open the feature table and click on the button with a dotted frame. In the dropdown menu select the geometry of the area:

* circle (click twice on the map, to choose the center of the circle and its size, the radius length is shown in meters)
* line (features intersected by the line will be filtered)
* rectangle (click on diagonally opposite apexes)
* free-hand drawn polygon (each click creates an apex, the area covered by the polygon is highlighted; to finish the shape, double-click on an apex, the polygon will be completed automatically)

.. figure:: _static/ngweb_filter_by_area_geometry_en.png
   :name: ngweb_filter_by_area_geometry_pic
   :align: center
   :width: 20cm

   Selecting filter geometry

Now the feature table only contains the features within the selected area. The tool button will have the current area shape on it. In the dropdown menu you can use one of the following options:

* Show/Hide the outline and fill of the selected area
* Zoom to the filtering area
* Clear filtering geometry

.. figure:: _static/ngweb_filter_by_area_actions_en.png

If the resource is moved successfully, the information about it appears in the new resource group and is removed from the previous one.

If in the selected folder there is already a resource with the same name as the one you want to transfer, it will not be moved and the following message will appear:

.. figure:: _static/parent_change_name_not_unique_en.png

2. Type: String, Numer, Boolean, Empty (if you select "Empty", the value field will be cleared)
3. Value. Value corresponds to the key type

The tab "Attributes" contains a table with vector layer attributes (see :numref:`ngweb_admin_layers_attr`).

While exporting to some formats additional files are created, for example CSVT (field description) and PRJ (projection description) for CSV, CPG (code page) for ESRI Shapefile.

To export data:

#. Open a Vector or PostGIS layer, the data of which you want to export;
#. Select the item: menuselection: `Features -> Save As` on the right pane :ref:` web interface <ngw_admin_interface> `;
#. Specify the format and encoding of the data and select fields to be exported;
#. If necessary, you can compress the result into a ZIP archive (for a number of formats this is the default setting);
#. Save the file to your device.
